This is the repo of our work titled “Neural Codec Source Tracing: Toward Comprehensive Attribution in Open-Set Condition”, which was available on arxiv at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06514.

Due to platform restrictions on the size of zenodo repositories, we have divided the Codecfake dataset into two subsets as shown in the table below:

| ST-Codecfake            | Description                                      | Link                                                                 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| main part               | training, development, evaluation (ID & OOD)     | [https://zenodo.org/records/14631091](https://zenodo.org/records/14631091) |
| open-set evaluation part| ID config, ID source, OOD config, OOD source, ALM| [https://zenodo.org/records/14631085](https://zenodo.org/records/14631085) |


I will update readme within one week.
